The wine was born in Burgundy (France) but found its way to Switzerland in the 1300s, where it was considered a favorite of the Emperor. From here the grape made its way to northern Italy, and the real story of Pinot Grigio was born. In Italy, Pinot Gris became Pinot Grigio and the wine found wide success in the regions of Northeastern Italy: Lombardy, the Veneto, Friuli, Trentino and Alto Adige. From its footing in northern Italy, the wine grew to become the most popular white wine in all of Italy, and then the most popular imported white wine in the U.S."

        "history": "Often referred to as the “white nebbiolo“, it is most commonly found in the hills of the Roero, northwest of Alba, growing in the heart of red wine country, alongside Nebbiolo and Barbara. It is for that reason that it almost went dinosaur on us. When you have to compete for growing space with some of the heaviest hitters in all of Italian wines, and are challenging to grow, it’s a hard battle to win. Arneis owes its existence, in part, from the efforts of one winemaker, Alfredo Currado of the Vietti family, who brought it back from scarcity. Known in Piemonte to mean “little rascal“, Arneis is regarded as a somewhat difficult variety to grow but was once used to blend with Nebbiolo as a way of softening its tannic nature. Thanks to the revitalization, the grape went from 2 producers in the 1970s to multiple producers making more than 1 million gallons of the stuff today."

Moved by our conviction that improvement comes only through respect for natural equilibriums, year on year we have rigorously applied our philosophy that does not permit the unrestrained use of technology and chemicals. We have decided to intervene as little as possible in what are natural processes, adhering to the concept that high-quality D.O.C. wine “has the mark of the vine on its grapes.” Convinced that a fine wine is born from the sum of so many small details, our objective must not only be to always produce fine wine, but also to make sure that our wines are always authentic.",

Unlike most other varietals, this grape makes nice wine even when produced in large quantities. The grape has a deep purple and ruby color to its juice. It has lower acidity (especially for an Italian varietal) and mild sweeter tannins. The resulting wines tend to be softer and more accessible than Chianti or Nebbiolo for example. Accordingly, the young wines are nice pleasurable reds that go as well with food as without it. Heading due east from Rome lays the region of Abruzzo. This is a historically poor region whose people inhabit the hills and mountains so prevalent in the province. The hillsides are excellent for viticulture. La Valentina Farm was born on the hills overlooking Spoltore, which is near Pescara in Central Italy, in 1990.

The flavors and acidity are, in well-made specimens, elegantly balanced. It is interesting that some descriptions have it as a notably high-acid wine, while other reviewers describe it as soft and moderate to low in acid; presumably those are simply the results of different vinification methods.
